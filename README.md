# Reach-Transit

I honestly do not know what to add in this README.

<!-- files -->
There are 11 files in all, including the README me file and one folder
Four html files, four css files, three script files, one folder and lastly this file itself

I will give a summary of how everything is arranged ranging from styles to scripts and any necessary details you will need.

<!-- html files -->

The main, is the index.html file from there I believe you will be able to navigate your way.

<!-- style files -->

The style files are basically the same.
So why did I seperate them? Well I don't know either, it just seemed right at the moment, and also for the fact that not all the styles had the same features always.

  Basic Features that I added in the styles
  --white-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --red-color: hsl(0, 99%, 41%);
  --black-color: hsl(0, 0%, 0%);
  --font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
  --gray-color: rgb(95, 95, 95);
